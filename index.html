        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Andy Liang and I was born in Guangzhou, China. I was raised as an kid that had expectations of becoming the best that I could be. I went to after school programs, summer programs and Chinese school to learn and improve myself. However the road to success was not an easy one, and I encountered constant obstacles along the way. My elementary school and middle school grades were not as good as my parents expected and I spent a lot of time fooling around instead of focusing academically. This was the reason I ended up going to after school and summer programs. My mom sent me to Chinese school so I didnâ€™t spend that much time at home playing around and because my Chinese was already in a decline. <br><br>

        Chinese school was not easy for me or other students. I went every Saturday morning and came back home with two to three more assignments which caused me to complain to my parents. As a retaliation, I ended up fooling around first my first few years of chinese school and lying to my parents about finishing my assignments. I learned by 3rd grade and started to try to change myself. I entered a Chinese poem recital contest in 3rd grade and ended up with 2nd place. I got 3rd place the following year. I also conducted at the Chinese school anthem 3 years in a row. I got to graduate from chinese school 3 times, kindergarten, elementary school and middle school. I did not get to graduate from their chinese high school because I had started a year late and so I did not have the time to finish my last year since I had to start college.<br><br>

        I have two different work experiences, volunteer and tutoring. I would not consider tutoring to be an job that I have done before as I am only tutoring my friends currently and am not getting paid for it yet. My ability to teach someone is very good according to my experiences as my friends have passed their classes due to my teaching. They have often told me how their professors fail at teaching them and made it confusing to understand the problems, while my lessons were easy to understand and improve off of. As for volunteering, it was during my freshman year when I needed volunteer hours in order to graduate. I volunteered over the summer at an summer program called Aim High, that I went to as a middle schooler. I helped the teachers and assistant teachers prepare for their classes by getting them their supplies. I also helped lead some of the events that we did and even watched over the students. As for why I decided to volunteer at Aim High, it was because I really enjoyed their program as a student. Aim High not only teaches you multiple subjects, but balances it out by giving the students a time frame to play sports and do other activities.
